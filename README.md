- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ChrisWhealy
- ðŸ‘€ I'm open to work as a developer using Rust (WebAssembly) or Kotlin or Typescript/JavaScript.
- I have worked most expensively in the areas of cross-system communication and APIs

- Outside work, I play the drums, do sound engineering, post-production and live streaming (not all at the same time though...)
