- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ChrisWhealy
- I work as a Technical Specialist for [lighthouse.no](https://lighthouse.no) in the areas of SAP's Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), Business Technology Platform (BTP) and integration with non-SAP environments
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in WebAssembly, Rust and Kotlin
- Outside work, I play the drums, do sound engineering, post-production and live streaming (not all at the same time though...)
